# Systems from Scratch

Welcome to **Systems from Scratch**! This repository is a journey into the foundations of critical software systems, where Iâ€™m diving deep into how things work under the hood. Here, youâ€™ll find my implementations of various systems and tools, all built from the ground up.

## ðŸ“– About This Repository

The goal of this repository is to gain a deeper understanding of the core components behind widely-used technologies by re-creating simplified versions of them. Instead of using high-level APIs or libraries, Iâ€™m building out functionality step-by-step, learning by doing and exploring:

- **How databases manage data**
- **How web servers handle requests**
- **How container engines isolate environments**
- And much more!

### ðŸš€ Project Highlights

Each directory represents a specific project where I build a foundational technology. Some examples include:

- **Databases**: Constructing a basic data store and learning how indexing, querying, and persistence work.
- **Web Servers**: Creating a simple server to understand HTTP, request handling, and client-server interactions.
- **Containers**: Implementing a basic container engine to explore namespaces, file systems, and process isolation.
- **More**: With time, we are going to build many things in this repository which i even do not know.

Each project is split into milestones, each building on the last to create a complete and functional component. Tests and examples are included along the way to validate and demonstrate core features.

### ðŸŒ± Learning Mindset

The purpose here isnâ€™t simply to "build" these systems but to **understand them deeply**. By coding these systems from scratch, Iâ€™m focused on:

1. **Uncovering the Internals**: Breaking down complex concepts to understand the "why" and "how" behind them.
2. **Strengthening Fundamentals**: Reinforcing foundational skills in networking, file handling, data structures, and system-level programming.
3. **Problem Solving**: Tackling each challenge with a problem-solverâ€™s mindset to explore new perspectives and approaches.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

Iâ€™m implementing these systems in various languages to adapt to different paradigms and learn unique language features. Some languages Iâ€™ll be working with include:

- **TypeScript**
- **Python**
- **Java**

Each language offers new insights and challenges, adding a layer of learning to each project.
